# Background

I was switching my feed reader over to [Fever](http://www.feedafever.com/), and I really wanted to include a bunch of my updates from Twitter as "sparks", but I discovered that *TWITTER DECIDED TO SHUT DOWN ALL THEIR RSS FEEDS*.

So this is a stupid little Herkou app that generates feeds for searches and such that you can suck into your feed reader or whatever.

# Configuration

You'll need to export 4 environment variables to your Heroku environment:

* TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
* TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET
* TWITTER_OAUTH_TOKEN
* TWITTER_OAUTH_SECRET
